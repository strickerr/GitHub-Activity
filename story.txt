There once was an old man that walked with a cane. His dream was to travel the world, but he had very little money to do so. He only had enough for a one way flight to Paris,
the place he wanted to go most. He decided that he would figure out the rest once he arrived, otherwise he wouldn't have gone at all. So when he finally got there, he
noticed that people were very kind and generous.
